![Sample of the PyCon 2019 Poster](functionfiasco-poster-pycon2019.png)

This repository contains the LaTeX source code and additional resources for a
poster that [Gregory M. Kapfhammer](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/), with
the support of students in the Department of Computer Science at Allegheny
College, gave at the PyCon 2019 conference. The poster uses the
[rafaelbailo/betterposter-latex-template](https://github.com/rafaelbailo/betterposter-latex-template).
It also uses the [smartphone
icon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/smartphone_65680) by
[Freepik](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik). You are welcome to use this
source code as inspiration for your own technical poster. If you find this
example useful, could I trouble you to star this repository?

You can type the following command if you want to clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/gkapfham/pycon2019-functionfiasco-poster.git
```

Then, if you want to compile the presentation to a PDF, you should type the
following commands.

```shell
cd pycon2019-functionfiasco-poster
pdflatex functionfiasco-poster-pycon2019.tex
```

You can also compile the paper using other LaTeX development tools, such as
`latexmk`. If you are unable to compile the presentation with your development
tools and your execution environment, then please open a new issue and I will
attempt to resolve your concerns.
